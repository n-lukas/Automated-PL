## Purpose
This project was created to automate the process of creating a P&L statement. It has various usecases including managing business financials, personal finance, and project P&Ls. The data for the P&L is based on user-inputted transactional data. This data can be entered by the user or downloaded by an ERP to create a more autonomous process. Both actual transactions and forecasts can be entered to create a full P&L outlook.
